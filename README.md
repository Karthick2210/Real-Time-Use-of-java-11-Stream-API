# Java 11 Stream Examples: Solving Real-Life Complex Problems

This repository contains a collection of real-time examples that demonstrate how Java 11 Stream API can be leveraged to solve complex problems efficiently and elegantly. The Stream API introduced in Java 8 provides a functional programming paradigm for processing data in a declarative manner, making it a powerful tool for handling various scenarios.

## Why Java 11 Stream?

Java 11 Stream API allows developers to perform advanced operations on collections, such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and aggregating elements. By using streams, you can write **concise** and **expressive** code that is both **readable** and **maintainable**. Streams also provide **parallel processing** capabilities, enabling you to take advantage of multi-core processors and greatly improve performance for computationally intensive tasks.
